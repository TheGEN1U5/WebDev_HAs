            Just like a coin has two sides, watching Web-Series also has two sides, the first side is quite healthy while the other one is evil.
            Choosing between the two depends on the viewer/audience. In some cases, these Web based shows may lead to the ddvelopment of a new being that'd be quite efficient,
            while, in other cases the same shows may lead to the development of the negative side of the person who has a calm and angelic personality in the real world.
            Some Negative effects may include:-

                    People justify spending time in the evening in front of their television or computer screens and this eats up their precious hours.
                    It all starts with the ending of a tiring day in the evening, they watch one episode, then another, then another, then another, just because
                    at the end of the last episode they watched, they were left hanging for a suspense that is continued in the next episode. This creates a chain reaction.
                    and people don't realize how much time they have wasted. This wasting of time is also known as the Netflix Effect.

                    A recent study has shown that people who watch Web-series are less prone to be responsible and are more time wasters. 
                    Netflix harms the society in many ways, be it by introducing sentiment hurting vulgar language or be it
                    by portraying explicit and vulgar content in any form of media, audio or video that is not suitable for certain age groups.
                    People are drawn from their college campuses and work areas to the world of these shows.

                    The Netflix Effect discussed earlier not only spellbounds Adults but also impacts children and teens. A recent study has proven that teens are more attracted
                    to the lust and luxuries portrayed by the fictional characters in these shows, this may lead to the development of arrogance and other feelings in these young minds.
                    Teens are the most affected by this as their adolescent and are more prone to being influenced to drugs and other malpractices prtrayed in these shows.
                    Although, these series/subscriptions are not meant for these age groups, but still they find ways of getting out passwords from their parents.
