                            <dd>
                                This game sets on a sci-fi plot of the player being able to shift between cars. The plot is that the crime
                                lord Jericho is on the loose and where the player plays as a cop and not a normal one but the one who is in 
                                the realm of dreams and can do nothing but drive car<b>s</b>, as he can shift between cars being driven in 
                                the real world and can take control of different drivers around the city to gather clues to cathch the crime 
                                lord Jericho.

                                This is a game that was fun to play personally for me. The game is set on the sci-fi plot of the player's
                                Grandfather inventing a Time Portal but accidentally leaving it open to cause ripples and disturbances in
                                time, like peices of gadgets from the future ending up in the hands of Egyptian mummies. This is more or
                                less an object finding game but the objects aren't in one peice and are scattered around different places 
                                in different times. The objective of the game is obviously to find these and return safely back home.

                                This franchise of the Burnout Series features the same objective, Drive, Race, Destruct <b>BUT</b> with
                                awesome graphics and a bit of a plot related to DJ Atomica.  You get to choose from 80 different cars
                                (and 10 different motorbikes if you buy the full game) obviously that need to be earned. There are 6
                                differeent types of races and all of the races start using the special Burnout Shortcut i.e
                                <b>UpArrow + DownArrow</b>. This is a superb game to pay and I recommend it to everyone.

                                The best part of NFS Franchise is the plot and yet again though very old Gameloft surprises us with a plot
                                in which you are in  a Need For Speed to get away from the cops save your Unique, Marvellous Car. Did you ask
                                reason why the cops are behind you? It's simple. You were found illegally street racing.

                                four allies try to complete it before a corporation run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn) can do so.
