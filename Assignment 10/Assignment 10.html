    <p id="p3">Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an 
        organism. Food is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains 
        essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, 
        or minerals. The subsatnce is ingested by an organismand assimiliated 
        by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate 
        growth.

        Historically, humans secured food through two methods: 
        <span id="p4e1">
            hunting and gathering and agriculture
        </span>
        , which gave modern humans a mainly omnivorous 
        diet. Worldwide, humanity has created numerous cuisine and culinary 
        arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and 
        dishes 
    </p>
    <p id="p5">
        Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing 
        population of the world is supplied by the food industry. Food safety and 
        food security are monitored by agencies like the International 
        Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World 
        Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International 
        Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, 
        biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population 
        growth, water supply, and access to food.

        The right to food is a human right derived from the 
        <span id="p6e1">
            International Convenant oon Economic, Social and Culural Rights (ICESCR)
        </span>
        , recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including 
        adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from 
        hunger."
